TDS PROJECT 2
---------------------------

This repository contains my work for the 2nd Project of the Tools in Data Science course. Here, the autolysis file analyzes a dataset and performs sophisticated data analysis such as outlier detection, correlation heatmap printing and pairplot printing. This summary of this data is sent to a LLM which narrates a story of what the dataset initially included and what methods were carried out for preprocessing and analysis. The results (png files and README summary) for goodreads, happiness and media datasets have been stored in the folders with their respective names.
